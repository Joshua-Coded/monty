monty interpreter
The Monty language
Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

Monty byte code files
Files containing Monty byte codes usually have the .m extension. Most of the industry uses this standard but it is not required by the specification of the language. There is not more than one instruction per line. There can be any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its argument:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/000.m
push 0$
push 1$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
push 4$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
pall$
julien@ubuntu:~/monty$
Monty byte code files can contain blank lines (empty or made of spaces only, and any additional text after the opcode or its required argument is not taken into account:

julien@ubuntu:~/monty$ cat -e bytecodes/001.m
push 0 Push 0 onto the stack$
push 1 Push 1 onto the stack$
$
push 2$
  push 3$
                   pall    $
$
$
                           $
push 4$
$
    push 5    $
      push    6        $
$
pall This is the end of our program. Monty is awesome!$

Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, I understood:

General
What do LIFO and FIFO mean
What is a stack, and when to use it
What is a queue, and when to use it
What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
What is the proper way to use global variables
Compilation & Output
The code was compiled this way
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=c90 *.c -o monty

All output was printed on stdout
All error message was printed on stderr
The monty program

Usage: monty file
where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code
If the user does not give any file or more than one argument to your program, print the error message USAGE: monty file, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
If, for any reason, it's not possible to open the file, print the error message Error: Can't open file <file>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where <file> is the name of the file
If the file contains an invalid instruction, print the error message L<line_number>: unknown instruction <opcode>, followed by a new line, and exit with the status EXIT_FAILURE
where is the line number where the instruction appears.
Line numbers always start at 1
The monty program runs the bytecodes line by line and stop if either:
it executed properly every line of the file
it finds an error in the file
an error occured
If you can't malloc anymore, print the error message Error: malloc failed, followed by a new line, and exit with status EXIT_FAILURE.
You have to use malloc and free and are not allowed to use any other function from man malloc (realloc, calloc, ...
